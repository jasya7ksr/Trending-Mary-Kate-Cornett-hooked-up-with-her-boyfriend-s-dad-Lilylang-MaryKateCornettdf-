Mary Kate Cornett trending on X amid Ole Miss scandal and viral meme coin controversy


University of Mississippi student Mary Kate Cornett became a trending topic on X, formerly Twitter, on February 26 after allegations surfaced that she was involved in an affair with her boyfriend’s father. The controversy has gained significant traction online, with social media users widely discussing the claims and even creating a meme coin inspired by the situation.
According to a viral post shared by X user @MAGAgeddon, Cornett allegedly became intimate with her boyfriend Evan’s father, identified as Private Banker Erik Solis. The post referenced a screenshot of a Snapchat message claiming that Cornett had returned home early after completing her exams. She reportedly took Evan’s younger sister to a basketball game, accompanied by Evan’s father. Later that evening, Cornett and Solis allegedly went out for drinks, which led to the start of their alleged affair.

Further claims in the viral post suggested that Solis reassured Cornett about his history of infidelity, stating he had cheated on his wife multiple times. Speculation also indicated that Evan eventually discovered the affair, but he and Cornett later reconciled. Meanwhile, Solis’ wife was reportedly aware of the situation but was considering divorce for unrelated reasons.
